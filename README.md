Customer Spend & Churn Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts customer future spending and churn risk using real-world e-commerce data.
It combines regression (to forecast spending) and classification (to predict churn) while demonstrating strong ML concepts:

Linear Regression → Forecast future customer spend

Logistic Regression → Predict churn probability

Model Evaluation → Accuracy, AUC, Log Loss, Precision/Recall

Threshold Optimization → Maximized business revenue captured

Hyperparameter Tuning → Improved performance with regularization

🚀 Problem Statement

E-commerce businesses often struggle with:

Identifying high-value customers likely to churn

Allocating retention resources effectively

Minimizing revenue lost to customer attrition

🔑 Impact

Regression Model achieved 52.7% improvement over baseline in predicting spend.

Churn Model achieved:

Accuracy: 73%

AUC: 0.85

Log Loss: 0.43

By optimizing the churn threshold:

Revenue saved increased from $77K → $101K

31.7% more revenue protected

📊 This demonstrates how ML can directly impact business profitability.
